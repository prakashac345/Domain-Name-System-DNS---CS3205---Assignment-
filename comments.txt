I confirm that the source file is entirely written by me without
resorting to any dishonest means.

From This Assignment I have learnt:
How a simple hierarchical Domain Name Server (DNS) system, with a client and a set of relevant DNS servers works, and how to implement it using sockets.
How to use the DNS protocol to resolve a domain name to an IP address, and it helped me to understand the DNS protocol in detail.

My Code Doesnot Run Work in linux , so I cant submit my Script file for the same.
Please consider it 

A Possible Improvement:
We can have different input files for each server which contains details about only that server and its corresponding IP address. 
This will help us to reduce the time complexity of the program ,and it will help in making the program look more like a real DNS server working in a real network.
